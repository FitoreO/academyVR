# ACADEMY360

This is a demo where we used React webVR in order to present our school Academy in 360. The project is in Swedish but do feel free to have a look anyways.

We had noticed that they were facing minor issues in presenting their idea which among many sounds too good to be true.

Our solution was to get away from the usual webpages and invite people to be able to experience the school in a different way.

# PROBLEMS/SOLUTIONS

While starting this project we realized that the documentation of react360 was very limited. There were very few tutorials to be found on the subject 
that could help us in our project so much of what you see is experimentation where we tried different techniques in order to see what works.

# INSTALLATION

After you have cloned the project you can install the dependencies by running  <pre> npm install </pre>  in your git bash.
The installation will not work in the terminal that is in your code-editor.

Once all the dependencies have installed you can run <pre>npm start </pre> to see the project.


In the file directory there is a <pre><code> firebase.example.js </code></pre> file that you will have to fill in with your own info after you have created an app in firebase.
This is only used in the sentiment analysis. If you don't wish to use it, you can remove the firebase dependencies.

# CREDITS

The keyboard that is used along with sentiment analysis is a VR-keyboard designed by Daniel Buechele and can be found here: 
https://github.com/danielbuechele/react-360-keyboard.

Instead of using Redux we decided to use a more simplified code John Tucker. This code made it possible to pass information between 
different components. You can find his work here: https://github.com/larkintuckerllc/hello-react-360/tree/animated/src/rotate.js
